
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (encoded by FBN1 in humans and Fbn1 in mice), a matrix component of extracellular microfibrils. A distinct subgroup of individuals with Marfan syndrome have distal airspace enlargement, historically described as emphysema, which frequently results in spontaneous lung rupture (pneumothorax; refs. 1-3). To investigate the pathogenesis of genetically imposed emphysema, we analyzed the lung phenotype of mice deficient in fibrillin-1, an accepted model of Marfan syndrome. Lung abnormalities are evident in the immediate postnatal period and manifest as a developmental impairment of distal alveolar septation. Aged mice deficient in fibrillin-1 develop destructive emphysema consistent with the view that early developmental perturbations can predispose to late-onset, seemingly acquired phenotypes. We show that mice deficient in fibrillin-1 have marked dysregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activation and signaling, resulting in apoptosis in the developing lung. Perinatal antagonism of TGF-beta attenuates apoptosis and rescues alveolar septation in vivo. These data indicate that matrix sequestration of cytokines is crucial to their regulated activation and signaling and that perturbation of this function can contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.
The relationship between socio-economic status and health has been consistently reported and is thought to be causal. Socio-economic inequalities are present in the incidence of and mortality from cancer in general, but not in the incidence of colorectal cancer in particular. However, there are socio-economic gradients in mortality from colorectal cancer. The socio-economic distribution of incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer in individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome) is not known. It is possible that increased awareness of and access to screening for colorectal cancer amongst this group of individuals reduces the socio-economic gradients seen in the population as a whole. We investigated the relationship between socio-economic status and age of resection of colorectal cancer in a cohort of individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer. More affluent individuals tended to undergo surgical resection for colorectal cancers earlier in their lives than less affluent individuals. This relationship was bordering on statistical significance. This trend probably represents socio-economic variations in access to treatment. In addition, age based diagnostic criteria for hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer may, inadvertently, accentuate socio-economic inequalities in outcome.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to provide updated guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of girls and women with Turner syndrome (TS).PARTICIPANTS: The Turner Syndrome Consensus Study Group is a multidisciplinary panel of experts with relevant clinical and research experience with TS that met in Bethesda, Maryland, April 2006. The meeting was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and unrestricted educational grants from pharmaceutical companies.EVIDENCE: The study group used peer-reviewed published information to form its principal recommendations. Expert opinion was used where good evidence was lacking.CONSENSUS: The study group met for 3 d to discuss key issues. Breakout groups focused on genetic, cardiological, auxological, psychological, gynecological, and general medical concerns and drafted recommendations for presentation to the whole group. Draft reports were available for additional comment on the meeting web site. Synthesis of the section reports and final revisions were reviewed by e-mail and approved by whole-group consensus.CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that parents receiving a prenatal diagnosis of TS be advised of the broad phenotypic spectrum and the good quality of life observed in TS in recent years. We recommend that magnetic resonance angiography be used in addition to echocardiography to evaluate the cardiovascular system and suggest that patients with defined cardiovascular defects be cautioned in regard to pregnancy and certain types of exercise. We recommend that puberty should not be delayed to promote statural growth. We suggest a comprehensive educational evaluation in early childhood to identify potential attention-deficit or nonverbal learning disorders. We suggest that caregivers address the prospect of premature ovarian failure in an open and sensitive manner and emphasize the critical importance of estrogen treatment for feminization and for bone health during the adult years. All individuals with TS require continued monitoring of hearing and thyroid function throughout the lifespan. We suggest that adults with TS be monitored for aortic enlargement, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.
Marfan syndrome is a multisystem connective tissue disorder usually associated with mutation in fibrillin, and occasionally with mutation in TGFBR1 or 2. The clinical diagnosis is made using the Ghent nosology, which will unequivocally diagnose or exclude Marfan syndrome in 86% of cases. Use of a care pathway can help implementation of the nosology in the clinic. The penetrance of some features is age dependent, so the nosology must be used with caution in children. Molecular testing may be helpful in this context. The nosology cannot be used in families with isolated aortic dissection, or with related conditions such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, although it may help identify families for further diagnostic evaluation because they do not fulfill the nosology, despite a history of aneurysm. Prophylactic medical (eg beta-blockade) and surgical intervention is important in reducing the cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome. Musculoskeletal symptoms are common, although the pathophysiology is less clear--for example, the correlation between dural ectasia and back pain is uncertain. Symptoms in other systems require specialist review such as ophthalmology assessment of refractive errors and ectopia lentis. Pregnancy is a time of increased cardiovascular risk for women with Marfan syndrome, particularly if the aortic root exceeds 4 cm at the start of pregnancy. High-intensity static exercise should be discouraged although low-moderate intensity dynamic exercise may be beneficial. The diagnosis and management of Marfan syndrome requires a multidisciplinary team approach, in view of its multisystem effects and phenotypic variability.
Turner syndrome occurs in one out of every 2,500 to 3,000 live female births. The syndrome is characterized by the partial or complete absence of one X chromosome (45,X karyotype). Patients with Turner syndrome are at risk of congenital heart defects (e.g., coarctation of aorta, bicuspid aortic valve) and may have progressive aortic root dilatation or dissection. These patients also are at risk of congenital lymphedema, renal malformation, sensorineural hearing loss, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, and atherogenic lipid profile. Patients usually have normal intelligence but may have problems with nonverbal, social, and psychomotor skills. Physical manifestations may be subtle but can include misshapen ears, a webbed neck, a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, and cubitus valgus. A Turner syndrome diagnosis should be considered in girls with short stature or primary amenorrhea. Patients are treated for short stature in early childhood with growth hormone therapy, and supplemental estrogen is initiated by adolescence for pubertal development and prevention of osteoporosis. Almost all women with Turner syndrome are infertile, although some conceive with assisted reproduction.
Marfan syndrome is a connective-tissue disease inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and caused mainly by mutations in the gene FBN1. This gene encodes fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein that is the main constituent of the microfibrils of the extracellular matrix. Most mutations are unique and affect a single amino acid of the protein. Reduced or abnormal fibrillin-1 leads to tissue weakness, increased transforming growth factor beta signaling, loss of cell-matrix interactions, and, finally, to the different phenotypic manifestations of Marfan syndrome. Since the description of FBN1 as the gene affected in patients with this disorder, great advances have been made in the understanding of its pathogenesis. The development of several mouse models has also been crucial to our increased understanding of this disease, which is likely to change the treatment and the prognosis of patients in the coming years. Among the many different clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome, cardiovascular involvement deserves special consideration, owing to its impact on prognosis. However, the diagnosis of patients with Marfan syndrome should be made according to Ghent criteria and requires a comprehensive clinical assessment of multiple organ systems. Genetic testing can be useful in the diagnosis of selected cases.
Noonan and Noonan-like syndromes are disorders of dysregulation of the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS)-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In Noonan syndrome (NS), four genes of this pathway (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS) are responsible for roughly 70% of the cases. We analyzed PTPN11 and KRAS genes by bidirectional sequencing in 95 probands with NS and 29 with Noonan-like syndromes, including previously reported patients already screened for PTPN11 gene mutations. In the new patients with NS, 20/46 (43%) showed a PTPN11 gene mutation, two of them novel. In our total cohort, patients with NS and a PTPN11 mutation presented significantly higher prevalence of short stature (p = 0.03) and pulmonary valve stenosis (p = 0.01), and lower prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.01). Only a single gene alteration, of uncertain role, was found in the KRAS gene in an NS patient also presenting a PTPN11 gene mutation. We further analyzed the influence in clinical variability of three frequent polymorphisms found in the KRAS gene and no statistically significant difference was observed among the frequency of clinical findings regarding the studied polymorphisms.
Noonan syndrome is a relatively common developmental disorder that is characterized by reduced growth, wide-set eyes and congenital heart defects. Noonan syndrome is associated with dysregulation of the Ras-mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Recently, two mutations in NRAS were reported to be associated with Noonan syndrome, T50I and G60E. Here, we report a mutation in NRAS, resulting in an I24N amino acid substitution, that we identified in an individual bearing typical Noonan syndrome features. The I24N mutation activates N-Ras, resulting in enhanced downstream signaling. Expression of N-Ras-I24N, N-Ras-G60E or the strongly activating mutant N-Ras-G12V, which we included as a positive control, results in developmental defects in zebrafish embryos, demonstrating that these activating N-Ras mutants are sufficient to induce developmental disorders. The defects in zebrafish embryos are reminiscent of symptoms in individuals with Noonan syndrome and phenocopy the defects that other Noonan-syndrome-associated genes induce in zebrafish embryos. MEK inhibition completely rescued the activated N-Ras-induced phenotypes, demonstrating that these defects are mediated exclusively by Ras-MAPK signaling. In conclusion, mutations in NRAS from individuals with Noonan syndrome activated N-Ras signaling and induced developmental defects in zebrafish embryos, indicating that activating mutations in NRAS cause Noonan syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: To define sonographic criteria that may improve the prenatal diagnosis of Noonan syndrome by targeted DNA testing.METHODS: We searched our Fetal Medicine Unit records for all cases with a final diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. A literature review was undertaken to identify the sonographic features of Noonan syndrome fetuses. Information was pooled to define the most common features.RESULTS: In our database, we identified three cases of Noonan syndrome. The diagnosis was suspected prenatally in two of them. Thirty-nine cases were identified in the literature. In the presented cases we show that suspicion of Noonan syndrome should arise when, after an increased nuchal translucency, ultrasound investigation in the second trimester shows a persistant nuchal fold (NF) or cystic hygroma in combination with at least one of the following features: hydrops fetalis, pleural effusion, cardiac anomalies, polyhydramnios or specific facial abnormalities.CONCLUSION: Prenatal ultrasound findings in Noonan syndrome can be subtle and aspecific, but when specific characteristics are present additional targeted DNA analysis is indicated.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Noonan syndrome, a distinctive syndrome characterized by dysmorphism, cardiac abnormalities and developmental delay, has been associated with a number of malignancies, however, only a few cases of primary glial or glioneuronal neoplasms have been reported. We report here the case of an 18-year-old with Noonan syndrome who developed a rosette forming glioneuronal tumor of the posterior fossa. The tumor demonstrated strong pERK immunoreactivity, suggesting MAPK/ERK pathway activation. Molecular testing did not reveal BRAF rearrangements (fusion transcripts) by PCR or a BRAFV600E mutation by sequencing. We review the literature regarding the molecular pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome and primary brain tumors, and consider the intriguing link between their common molecular pathways.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although historically Marfan syndrome (MFS) has always been considered as a condition caused by the deficiency of a structural extracellular matrix protein, fibrillin-1, the study of Marfan mouse models and Marfan-related conditions has shifted our current understanding to a pathogenic model that involves dysregulation of the cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling.RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we focus on the impact of the revised MFS clinical diagnostic criteria. We discuss lessons that have been learned from molecular findings in relevant Marfan-related conditions, such as sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection, stiff skin syndrome, acromelic dysplasias and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We explore the latest insights into the role of the alternative TGF-β signaling pathways in MFS pathogenesis. Finally, we give an update on the current and future treatment strategies.SUMMARY: The recent insights into the pathogenesis of MFS and related disorders have offered a prime example of translational medicine with immediate bridge between molecular findings and therapeutic options.
Liver test abnormalities are frequent in adult patients with Turner syndrome, corresponding to various pathophysiological mechanisms. Steatosis, steatofibrosis and steatohepatitis are the most frequently reported lesions, caused by metabolic disorders, which are commonly related to overweight. Marked architectural changes, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia, multiple focal nodular hyperplasia and cirrhosis, found in some patients, are associated with a risk of severe liver-related complications. Architectural changes are often observed and are associated with vascular disorders caused by congenitally abnormal vessels. Finally, small bile duct alterations resembling sclerosing cholangitis occur in several patients. Oestrogen replacement therapy does not cause liver toxicity in patients with Turner syndrome and is not contraindicated in case of elevated liver enzymes. Moreover, in recent studies, oestrogen therapy was reported to improve liver function tests. Because of the wide spectrum of potential liver injuries that may occur in Turner syndrome patients, a regular screening of liver enzymes is recommended for early detection and treatment.
The purpose of this report was to: summarize the care of a child between the ages of 12 to 16 years old born with Noonan-like central giant cell syndrome and unrelated common variable immune deficiency; provide information on the dental management of patients with Noonan's syndrome; and present a brief discussion of the recent associated genetic findings. A review of the common features of Noonan syndrome and Noonan-like central giant cell syndrome is also provided.
BACKGROUND: Chiari I malformations (CM-I) have been associated with a variety of developmental abnormalities in the literature. A few cases of CM-I in patients with Noonan syndrome (NS) have been reported; however, opinion remains divided as to whether the observed association is coincidental.DISCUSSION: Six previous cases of CM-I in patients with NS have been described in the literature. Many of these had other neurological abnormalities; however, neurological problems are not a prominent part of earlier descriptions of NS. A statistically significant association between NS and CM-I is difficult to obtain at present due to availability and logistical issues with scanning many asymptomatic patients. Although we believe a link exists between CM-I and NS, there is little understanding on how NS may cause CM-I. The most logical cause would be posterior fossa abnormality; however, the most common genetic mutation in NS tends to cause frontal and facial abnormalities, and the posterior fossa tends to be relatively spared. Other genetic mutations may also affect the posterior cranium and thus create the appropriate conditions for a CM-I to develop.ILLUSTRATIVE CASE: We report a case of CM-I in a 9-year-old patient with Noonan syndrome, severe scoliosis and syringomyelia.CONCLUSION: We believe that CM-I is a part of Noonan syndrome; however, statistical validation of this opinion is necessary.
The starting point, in Marfan syndrome (MFS) appears to be the mutation of fibrillin-1 gene whose deconstructed protein product cannot bind transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), leading to an increased TGF-b tissue level. The aim of this review is to review the already known features of the cellular signal transduction downstream to TGF-b and its impact on the tissue homeostasis of microfibrils, and elastic fibers. We also investigate current data on the extracellular regulation of TGF-b level including mechanotransduction and the feedback cycles of integrin-dependent and independent activation of the latent TGF-b complex. Together these factors, by the destruction of the connective tissue fibers, may play an important role in the development of the diverse cardiac and extracardiac manifestations of MFS and many of them could be a target of conservative treatment. We present currently investigated drugs for the treatment of the syndrome, and explore possible avenues of research into pathogenesis of MFS in order to improve understanding of the disease.
Marfan syndrome is a systemic, heritable connective tissue disorder that affects many different organ systems and is best managed by using a multidisciplinary approach. The guidance in this report is designed to assist the pediatrician in recognizing the features of Marfan syndrome as well as caring for the individual with this disorder.
Marfan syndrome is a multisystem connective tissue disorder, with primary involvement of the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. This autosomal heritable disease is mainly attributable to a defect in the FBN1 gene. Clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome has been based on the Ghent criteria since 1996. In 2010, these criteria were updated, and the revised guidelines place more emphasis on aortic root dilation, ectopia lentis, and FBN1 mutation testing in the diagnostic assessment of Marfan syndrome. Among its many different clinical manifestations, cardiovascular involvement deserves special consideration, owing to its impact on prognosis. Recent molecular, surgical, and clinical research has yielded profound new insights into the pathological mechanisms that ultimately lead to tissue degradation and weakening of the aortic wall, which has led to exciting new treatment strategies. Furthermore, with the increasing life expectancy of patients with Marfan syndrome, there has been a subtle shift in the spectrum of medical problems. Consequently, this article focuses on recent advances to highlight their potential impact on future concepts of patient care from a clinical, surgical, and anesthetic perspective.
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a relatively common and often lethal disease of connective tissue. Medical, surgical and basic research advances over the last two decades have had a major positive impact on the clinical management of MFS patients. Life expectancy has increased significantly, more discriminating diagnostic criteria have been developed, a number of new clinical entities have been recognized, and exciting opportunities for drug-based therapy have emerged. Despite such a remarkable progress, MFS diagnosis remains difficult and aortic disease progression is very heterogeneous and clinical outcome is unpredictable. Ongoing research efforts are therefore exploiting animal models of MFS to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, genetic, epigenetic and environmental modifiers and druggable biological targets.
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue caused by mutations in FBN1 gene. There are approximately 2-3,000 Marfan patients in The Netherlands. It has a broad clinical spectrum with features in most organ systems. Aortic root aneurysm is the most important clinical problem in these patients as it is progressive and leads to dissection and rupture if untreated. Endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated in all Marfan patients with aortic root aneurysm and operated patients. Timely diagnosis and specialized patient care are essential for the prognosis of this disease.
Turner syndrome occurs in women who are missing one X chromosome. The most obvious symptoms are small stature and ovarian failure. Turner patients have an increased risk of a large number of disorders, and should therefore have lifelong medical supervision. Recent insights into patient management have been incorporated into the guidelines. Patients are increasingly involved in their own treatment. In patients with 45,X karyotype, Y-chromosomal material is actively sought in a larger number of cells and/or other tissues, using FISH. Pubertal induction therapy, if required, is initiated at an appropriate age. Egg donation or vitrification are new therapeutic options for fertility treatment. Monitoring for cardiac and vascular disease using cardiac ultrasound and MRI is performed more often, partly in connection with the risk of aortal dissection. The coordination of care of patients with Turner syndrome is concentrated in specialized centres in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The purpose of this study was to explore the literature on the psychosocial aspects of Marfan syndrome (MFS), to critically appraise and to synthesize relevant literature. A mixed-method systematic review was performed by searching the published literature databases using available medical, psychological, pedagogical and social databases and other sources. All studies that addressed psychosocial aspects of MFS, published in peer-reviewed journals were assessed. Of 81 search results, 15 articles (four articles based on same study population) satisfied the eligibility criteria. All studies were cross-sectional; no intervention or randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies were found. Most studies were of small sample sizes, had low response rate or participants without a verified diagnosis. Despite these limitations, all studies described, that MFS has a significant impact on the psychosocial aspects of people's lives: Decreased quality of life; challenges in education, work and family life, depression and anxiety. Some studies indicated that the subjective perception of discomfort did not necessarily match the medical severity of a disease. The research of the psychosocial aspects of MFS is limited in size and quality. More research is needed on the psychosocial aspects of MFS in samples with a verified diagnosis to develop evidence-based knowledge and appropriate guidelines.
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of the connective tissue, caused by mutations of the gene FBN1, which encodes fibrillin-1, a major component of the microfibrils of the extracellular matrix. Fibrillin-1 interacts with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and dysregulated TGF-β signaling plays a major role in the development of connective tissue disease and familial aortic aneurysm and dissection, including Marfan syndrome. Losartan, an angiotensin II blocker, has the potential to reduce TGF-β signaling and is expected to be an additional therapeutic option. Clinical diagnosis is made using the Ghent nosology, which requires comprehensive patient assessment and has been proven to work well, but evaluation of some of the diagnostic criteria by a single physician is difficult and time-consuming. A Marfan clinic was established at the University of Tokyo Hospital in 2005, together with cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, pediatricians, orthopedists, and ophthalmologists in one place, for the purpose of speedy and accurate evaluation and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome, and the characteristics of Japanese patients with Marfan syndrome.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent understanding of the pathophysiology, molecular biology, and management of Turner syndrome.RECENT FINDINGS: Sophisticated genetic techniques are able to detect mosaicism in one-third of individuals previously thought to have monosomy X. Prenatal detection using maternal blood should permit noninvasive detection of most fetuses with an X chromosome abnormality. Disproportionate growth with short limbs has been documented in this condition, and a target gene of short stature homeobox, connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), has been described. Liver disease is more common in Turner syndrome than previously recognized. Most girls have gonadal failure. Spontaneous puberty and menarche is more commonly seen in girls with XX mosaicism. Low-dose estrogen replacement therapy may be given early to induce a more normal onset and tempo of puberty. Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction carries a substantial risk, particularly if the woman has known cardiac or aortic disease. Neurodevelopmental differences in Turner syndrome are beginning to be correlated with differences in brain anatomy.SUMMARY: An increased understanding of the molecular basis for aspects of this disorder is now developing. In addition, a renewed focus on health maintenance through the life span should provide better general and targeted healthcare for these girls and women.
BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with a spectrum of health problems across the age span, which requires particular attention during the transition period in these adolescents.AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The majority of girls with TS require oestrogen replacement from puberty onwards, which is important for adequate feminization, uterine development and maintenance of bone health. There is a lifetime increased risk from autoimmune conditions like hypothyroidism, coeliac disease, hearing loss and aortic dilatation with the potential to lead to aortic dissection. A systematic and holistic approach to provision of health care in TS is needed.AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Several unanswered questions remain, including the choice of hormone replacement therapy in the young person with TS and in adulthood; the optimal mode of cardiovascular assessment; the best management and assessment prior to and during pregnancy.AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: The optimal model of care and transition to adult services in TS requires attention. Further research is needed in relation to cardiovascular risk assessment, pregnancy management and hormone replacement therapy in TS.© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

Outlining specific protocols for the management of pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome has been challenging. This is mostly due to a dearth of clinical studies performed in pediatric patients. In Marfan syndrome, the major sources of morbidity and mortality relate to the cardiovascular system. In this review, we focus on aortic involvement seen in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome, ranging from aortic dilatation to aortic rupture and heart failure. We discuss the histological, morphological, and pathogenetic basis of the cardiac manifestations seen in pediatric Marfan syndrome and use a specific case to depict our experienced range of cardiovascular manifestations. The survival for patients with Marfan syndrome may approach the expected survival for non-affected patients, with optimal management. With this potentiality in mind, we explore possible and actual management considerations for pediatric Marfan syndrome, examining both medical and surgical therapy modalities that can make the possibility of improved survival a reality.
PURPOSE: Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, is a common genetic disease. The predisposition of patients with Lynch syndrome to urological cancer, particularly upper tract urothelial carcinoma, is underappreciated. Urologists may be involved in several aspects of care involving Lynch syndrome, including identifying undiagnosed patients, surveillance of those with established Lynch syndrome or screening family members, in addition to treating patients with Lynch syndrome in whom upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops. We sought to increase awareness in the urological community about Lynch syndrome and provide some guidance where little currently exists.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement we reviewed the available published literature and guidelines from 1998 to 2014 on Lynch syndrome and its association with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Recommendations based on the literature and the consensus of expert opinion are provided.RESULTS: No randomized or prospective study has been done to evaluate Lynch syndrome in the setting of urological cancer. All data were based on retrospective studies. Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by germline mutations in 4 mismatch repair genes, leading to the accumulation of DNA errors in microsatellite regions. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops in up to 28% of patients with known Lynch syndrome. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is established by clinical criteria, tumor tissue testing and genetic evaluation. Urologists should suspect Lynch syndrome when a patient with upper tract urothelial carcinoma presents before age 60 years or meets the 3-2-1 rule. Screening patients with Lynch syndrome for upper tract urothelial carcinoma presents a particular challenge. While no ideal screening test exists, at a minimum routine urinalysis is recommended using the American Urological Association guideline of 3 or more red blood cells per high power field as a trigger for further assessment. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma associated with Lynch syndrome presents at a younger age than sporadic upper tract urothelial carcinoma. It shows a higher proportion of ureteral cancer with a female preponderance and a possible predisposition to bilaterality.CONCLUSIONS: Lynch syndrome is a common genetic disease that is an underappreciated cause of upper tract urothelial carcinoma and possibly other urological cancers. Optimal screening for upper tract urothelial carcinoma in this population is unclear. Further study is needed to identify the best screening test and interval of testing. Urologists should consider routine tissue testing of de novo upper tract urothelial carcinoma tissue in individuals at risk.Copyright © 2015 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

Turner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder which impairs women's growth, reproductive function, cardiovascular development and other functions. This syndrome has been proposed as an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease. Despite this, life-threatening cardiovascular outcomes affecting young women are dismissed because of incomplete follow up. During assessment due to their smaller stature, it should be noted that, although the ascending aorta diameter is normal in absolute terms, after indexation for body size, patients with Turner syndrome may have a dilated aorta.Based on recent guidelines and the latest studies, there is new evidence on the use of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing aortic lesions. New management possibilities of aortopathies have also been discussed. This approach should optimise medical care for women with Turner syndrome, but many areas of uncertainty still remain in the diagnosis and management of this syndrome, and new prospective studies are needed.
Exercise recommendations for those who have Marfan syndrome or other genetic predisposition for thoracic aortic disease remain controversial and at times ambiguous. There are no outcomes studies to help guide recommendations. In this review, we examine the guidelines regarding exercise and inherited aortic conditions, the theoretical reasoning and circumstantial evidence that support the guidelines, as well as the knowledge gaps that continue to exist.
BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome is characterized by a great variability of clinical manifestations caused by a total or partial loss of X-chromosome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study of the diagnosis, course, and current status of patients with Turner syndrome followed up at our section over the past 40 years, based on review of medical records supplemented with a telephone survey.RESULTS: Forty-five female patients with a current mean age of 22.95years (range 2-38) and a mean age at diagnosis of 4.71 were included. Sixty-three percent of them showed a mosaic karyotype. Short stature was the most common reason for consultation (54%), with increased prenatal diagnosis in most recent cases. Seventy-two percent have been treated with growth hormone, together with oxandrolone in 26%. Final stature was short in 69% of patients. Gonadal failure was found in 66%; most of whom received replacement therapy. Three patients achieved pregnancy by oocyte donation. The 31 adult patients are mainly monitored by the endocrinology (37.5%) and/or gynecology (34.4%) departments. As regards psychosocial aspects, 22% required support during school, and 80% completed middle to high level education. Two patients died, one due to dissecting aortic aneurysm and the other one, who had multiple pathological conditions, from respiratory failure.CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is the main cause of diagnosis in patients with Turner syndrome; most cases show genetic mosaicism. The most common clinical manifestations include short stature and gonadal failure. Eighty percent of patients complete middle or high education. In adulthood, follow-up is irregular, sometimes scarce, and clearly improvable.Copyright © 2015 SEEN. Published by Elsevier España, S.L.U. All rights reserved.
In this overview we aim to address a number of recent insights and developments regarding clinical aspects, etiology, and treatment of Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease (H-TAD). We will focus on monogenetic disorders related to aortic aneurysms. H-TADs are rare but they provide a unique basis for the study of underlying pathogenetic pathways in the complex disease process of aneurysm formation. The understanding of pathomechanisms may help us to identify medical treatment targets to improve prognosis. Among the monogenetic aneurysm disorders, Marfan syndrome is considered as a paradigm entity and many insights are derived from the study of clinical, genetic and animal models for Marfan syndrome. We will therefore first provide a detailed overview of the various aspects of Marfan syndrome after which we will give an overview of related H-TAD entities.
Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) was previously synonymous with Lynch syndrome; however, identification of the role of germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes has made it possible to differentiate Lynch syndrome from other conditions associated with familial colorectal cancer (CRC). Broadly, HNPCC may be dichotomized into conditions that demonstrate defective DNA MMR and microsatellite instability (MSI) vs those conditions that demonstrate intact DNA MMR. Conditions characterized by MMR deficient CRCs include Lynch syndrome (germline MMR mutation), Lynch-like syndrome (biallelic somatic MMR mutations), constitutional MMR deficiency syndrome (biallelic germline MMR mutations), and sporadic MSI CRC (somatic biallelic methylation of MLH1). HNPCC conditions with intact DNA MMR associated with familial CRC include polymerase proofreading associated polyposis and familial colorectal cancer type X. Although next generation sequencing technologies have elucidated the genetic cause for some HNPCC conditions, others remain genetically undefined. Differentiating between Lynch syndrome and the other HNPCC disorders has profound implications for cancer risk assessment and surveillance of affected patients and their at-risk relatives. Clinical suspicion coupled with molecular tumor analysis and testing for germline mutations can help differentiate the clinical mimicry within HNPCC and facilitate diagnosis and management.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of Turner syndrome in a population-based, statewide cohort of girls with coarctation of the aorta.STUDY DESIGN: The Utah Birth Defects Network was used to ascertain a cohort of girls between 1997 and 2011 with coarctation of the aorta. Livebirths with isolated coarctation of the aorta or transverse arch hypoplasia were included and patients with complex congenital heart disease not usually seen in Turner syndrome were excluded.RESULTS: Of 244 girls with coarctation of the aorta, 77 patients were excluded, leaving a cohort of 167 girls; 86 patients (51%) had chromosomal studies and 21 (12.6%) were diagnosed with Turner syndrome. All patients were diagnosed within the first 4 months of life and 5 (24%) were diagnosed prenatally. Fifteen patients (71%) had Turner syndrome-related findings in addition to coarctation of the aorta. Girls with mosaicism were less likely to have Turner syndrome-associated findings (3/6 mosaic girls compared with 12/17 girls with non-mosaic 45,X). Twelve girls (57%) diagnosed with Turner syndrome also had a bicommissural aortic valve.CONCLUSION: At least 12.6% of girls born with coarctation of the aorta have karyotype-confirmed Turner syndrome. Such a high frequency, combined with the clinical benefits of an early diagnosis, supports genetic screening for Turner syndrome in girls presenting with coarctation of the aorta.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Marfan syndrome is the most prevalent connective tissue disorder, with an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. This paper aims to summarize epidemiology and treatment for type B dissection in Marfan patients.
The cooccurrence of Marfan syndrome and psychiatric disorders has been reported for many years. Furthermore, neuropsychological deficits have been shown to be associated with Marfan syndrome. The aim of the present article is to summarize findings from the sparse studies and case reports available. The results hold clinical and therapeutic implications and suggest that psychological and neuropsychological domains in Marfan syndrome patients should be carefully assessed. In particular, some patients may require specific rehabilitation programs. On this basis, a multidisciplinary approach to Marfan syndrome treatment seems mandatory.
AIM: Studies investigating the relationship between Turner syndrome and math learning disability have used a wide variation of tasks designed to test various aspects of mathematical competencies. Although these studies have revealed much about the math deficits common to Turner syndrome, their diversity makes comparisons between individual studies difficult. As a result, the consistency of outcomes among these diverse measures remains unknown. The overarching aim of this review is to provide a systematic meta-analysis of the differences in math and number performance between females with Turner syndrome and age-matched neurotypical peers.METHOD: We provide a meta-analysis of behavioral performance in Turner syndrome relative to age-matched neurotypical populations on assessments of math and number aptitude. In total, 112 comparisons collected across 17 studies were included.RESULTS: Although 54% of all statistical comparisons in our analyses failed to reject the null hypothesis, our results indicate that meaningful group differences exist on all comparisons except those that do not require explicit calculation.INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these results help elucidate our current understanding of math and number weaknesses in Turner syndrome, while highlighting specific topics that require further investigation.© 2015 Mac Keith Press.
The purpose of this study was to explore the literature on chronic pain in adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS), critically appraising and synthesizing relevant literature. A systematic review was conducted by searching the published literature databases using available medical, physical, psychological, social databases and other sources. All studies that addressed pain in MFS, published in peer-reviewed journals were assessed. Of 351 search results, 18 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. All studies were cross-sectional and quantitative; no randomized controlled trials or intervention studies were found. Most studies had small sample sizes, low response rates and mainly dealt with other aspects of the diagnosis than pain. Only one article dealt mainly with pain. The research on chronic pain in MFS is limited in size and quality. Despite these limitations, studies describe that the prevalence of pain in patients with MFS is high, varying from 47 to 92% and affecting several anatomic sites. In addition, chronic pain limits daily function and few studies describe treatment options for pain in patients with MFS. Research is needed to obtain more evidence-based knowledge for developing more appropriate rehabilitation programs for people with MFS.
Lung adenocarcinoma is a highly heterogeneous disease and the heterogeneity is associated with various patient outcomes even in early-stage tumors. In order to improve prognostic and predictive values, the IASLC/ATS/ERS international multidisciplinary lung adenocarcinoma classification was put forth in 2011 and it has been adopted in the recently published World Health Organization (WHO) classification of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart 4th edition 2015, and lung adenocarcinomas are classified based on the predominant pattern. The performance of the classification in stratifying patient outcomes after resection of Stage I tumors and predicting molecular alterations has been confirmed by several studies. It also includes the category of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) that predicts 100% 5-year recurrence free survival after curative resection similar to adenocarcinoma in situ. The diagnosis of MIA is based on not only size of the invasive component but also the absence of aggressive morphologic features such as pleural and/or lymphovascular invasion. Importantly, the WHO 2015 classification has introduced the concept of air space invasion and includes it as the exclusion criteria for MIA. The air space invasion consists of tumor islands and spread through air spaces (STAS). In this review, we will discuss the two entities and their clinical implications.
Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, is caused by inactivating mutations involving DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. This leads to profound genetic instability, including microsatellite instability (MSI) and increased risk for cancer development, particularly colon and endometrial malignancies. Clinical testing of tumor tissues for the presence of MMR gene deficiency is standard practice in clinical oncology, with immunohistochemistry and PCR-based microsatellite instability analysis used as screening tests to identify potential Lynch syndrome families. The ultimate diagnosis of Lynch syndrome requires documentation of mutation within one of the four MMR genes (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6) or EPCAM, currently achieved by comprehensive sequencing analysis of germline DNA. In this review, the genetic basis of Lynch syndrome, methodologies of MMR deficiency testing, and current diagnostic algorithms in the clinical management of Lynch syndrome, are discussed.
Over the past 4 decades, remarkable progress in understanding the cause, pathogenesis, and management of the MFS has led to an increase in life expectancy to near normal for most patients. Accompanying this increased life span has been the emergence of previously rare or unanticipated clinical problems. Despite much more detailed knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and tissue effects of a mutation in FBN1, targeted, effective therapy remains elusive. Until such precision medicine takes hold, management will depend on early diagnosis, regular scrutiny by imaging, chronic β-blockade, and perhaps ARBs, and prophylactic cardiothoracic surgery. Without question, MFS will remain a fertile subject for basic, translational, and clinical research for the foreseeable future.
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disease of the connective tissue due to mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). This study aimed at characterizing microelastic properties of the ascending aortic wall and lung parenchyma tissues from wild type (WT) and age-matched Fbn1 hypomorphic mice (Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice) to identify tissue-specific biomechanical effects of aging and disease in MFS. Atomic force microscopy was used to indent lung parenchyma and aortic wall tissues, using Hybrid Eshelby Decomposition analysis to extract layer-specific properties of the intima and media. The intima stiffened with age and was not different between WT and Fbn1(mgR/mgR) tissues, whereas the media layer of MFS aortas showed progressive structural and mechanical degradation with a modulus that was 50% softer than WT by 3.5 months of age. Similarly, MFS mice displayed progressive structural and mechanical deterioration of lung tissue, which was over 85% softer than WT by 3.5 months of age. Chronic treatment with the angiotensin type I receptor antagonist, losartan, attenuated the aorta and lung tissue degradation, resulting in structural and mechanical properties not significantly different from age-matched WT controls. By revealing micromechanical softening of elastin-rich aorta and lung tissues with disease progression in fibrillin-1 deficient mice, our findings support the use of losartan as a prophylactic treatment that may abrogate the life-threatening symptoms of MFS.
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of connective tissue that affects the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular, pulmonary, and nervous systems and is usually caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1. MFS is traditionally considered to result from the structural weakness of connective tissue. However, recent investigations on molecular mechanisms indicate that increased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MFS and related disorders, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), which is caused by mutation in TGF-β signaling-related genes. In addition, recent studies show that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling enhances cardiovascular pathologies in MFS, and the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan has the potential to inhibit aortic aneurysm formation. However, the relationship between TGF-β and AT1R signaling pathways remains poorly characterized. In this review, we discuss the recent studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular manifestations of MFS and LDS and the ensuing strategies for management.
BACKGROUND: Marfan's Syndrome (MFS) is a disorder of connective tissue, mainly involving the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems. The most severe problems include aortic root dilatation and dissection. Anesthetic management is vital for the improvement on perioperative morbidity.CASE REPORT: 61-year-old male with MFS, presenting mainly with pectus carinatum, scoliosis, ectopia lens, previous spontaneous pneumothorax and aortal aneurysm and dissection submitted to thoracoabdominal aortic prosthesis placement. Underwent routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to lithiasis. Important findings on preoperative examination were thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, metallic murmur on cardiac exam. Chest radiograph revealed Cobb angle of 70°. Echocardiogram showed evidence of aortic mechanical prosthesis with no deficits.DISCUSSION: Preoperative evaluation should focus on cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The anesthesiologist should be prepared for a potentially difficult intubation. Proper positioning and limb support prior to induction is crucial in order to avoid joint injuries. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis. The patient should be carefully positioned to avoid joint injuries. Intraoperatively cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory: avoid maneuvers that can lead to tachycardia or hypertension, control airway pressure to prevent pneumothorax and maintain an adequate volemia to decrease chances of prolapse, especially if considering laparoscopic surgery. No single intraoperative anesthetic agent or technique has demonstrated superiority. Adequate postoperative pain management is vitally important to avoid the detrimental effects of hypertension and tachycardia.Copyright © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia.

This is a focused update highlighting the most current NCCN Guidelines for diagnosis and management of Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancer, usually resulting from a germline mutation in 1 of 4 DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2), or deletions in the EPCAM promoter. Patients with Lynch syndrome are at an increased lifetime risk, compared with the general population, for colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and other cancers, including of the stomach and ovary. As of 2016, the panel recommends screening all patients with colorectal cancer for Lynch syndrome and provides recommendations for surveillance for early detection and prevention of Lynch syndrome-associated cancers.
Turner syndrome (TS) occurs in one in 2500 live female births and is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in women. Pregnancies in women with TS, conceived with either autologous or donated oocytes, are considered high risk because of the associated miscarriages and life-threatening cardiovascular complications (aortic dissection, severe hypertension). Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a full preconception evaluation and counselling that includes cardiac assessment with Holter blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography, and thoracic MRI. Abnormal findings, such an aortic dilatation, mandate close monitoring throughout the pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period and could possibly contraindicate pregnancy. When in vitro fertilization using donated oocytes is performed in these women, only a single embryo should be transferred. Women with a Turner mosaic karyotype appear to have a lower risk of obstetrical and cardiovascular complications but should nevertheless undergo the full preconception evaluation. In this article, we offer guidelines on the management of women with TS in the preconception period, during pregnancy, and postpartum.
Marfan syndrome is a rare multisystem disease of the connective tissue, which affects multiple organ systems. advances in healthcare have doubled the life-expectancy of patients over the past three decades. to date, there is no comprehensive review that consolidates economic considerations and care for marfan patients. Areas covered: Present research suggests that there may be a link between treatment pattern, disease progression and economic costs of Marfan syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the disease and preventive interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective, it may reduce the amount of emergency surgery or intervention, and inpatient stays. In addition, it slows disease progression, lowers lifestyle restrictions, reduces psychological stress, and improves health-related quality of life. Expert commentary: Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual aim by simultaneously containing costs and reducing the number and length of inpatient stays.
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder, predominantly affecting the ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems. Here, we present the results of the first genetic testing in 40 Ukrainian Marfan (-like) patients and 10 relatives. We applied a targeted next generation sequencing panel comprising FBN1 and 13 thoracic aortic aneurysm genes. We identified 27 causal mutations in FBN1, obtaining a mutation yield of 67·5%. A significant difference in age at aortic surgery between mutation positive and negative patients was observed. Thus, we conclude that genetic testing is important to identify patients at higher risk for developing life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
The clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome frequently cause pain. This study aimed to characterize pain in a cohort of adults with Marfan syndrome and investigate demographic, physical, and psychological factors associated with pain and pain-related disability. Two hundred and forty-five participants (73% female, 89% non-Hispanic white, 90% North American) completed an online questionnaire assessing clinical features of Marfan syndrome, pain severity, pain-related disability, physical and mental health, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and insomnia. Eighty-nine percent of respondents reported having pain with 28% of individuals reporting pain as a presenting symptom of Marfan syndrome. Almost half of individuals reported that pain has spread from its initial site. Participants in our study reported poor physical and mental health functioning, moderate pain-related disability, and mild levels of depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and pain catastrophizing. Those who identified pain as an initial symptom of Marfan syndrome and those who reported that pain had spread from its initial site reported greater psychological burden compared with those without pain as an initial symptom or pain spreading. Physical health is the largest predictor of pain severity and pain-related disability. While pain catastrophizing and worse mental health functioning are significant correlates of pain severity and pain-related disability, respectively. Pain is a significant and persistent problem in Marfan syndrome and is associated with profound disability and psychological burden. Further studies are indicated to better characterize the directionality of pain, pain-related disability, and psychological burden in Marfan syndrome.© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in pathogenesis of various cancers, including lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We used cBioPortal to analyze lncRNA alteration frequencies and their ability to predict overall survival (OS) using 504 LUSC and 522 LUAD samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In LUSC, 624 lncRNAs had alteration rates > 1% and 64 > 10%. In LUAD 625 lncRNAs had alteration rates > 1% and 36 > 10%. Among those, 620 lncRNAs had alteration frequencies > 1% in both LUSC and LUAD, while 22 were LUSC-specific and 23 were LUAD-specific. Twenty lncRNAs had alteration frequencies > 10% in both LUSC and LUAD, while 44 were LUSC-specific and 16 were LUAD specific. Genome ontology and pathway analyses produced similar results for LUSC and LUAD. Two lncRNAs (IGF2BP2-AS1 and DGCR5) correlated with better OS in LUSC, and three (MIR31HG, CDKN2A-AS1 and LINC01600) predicted poor OS in LUAD. Chip-seq and luciferase reporter assays identified potential IGF2BP2-AS1, DGCR5 and LINC01600 promoters and enhancers. This study presented lncRNA landscapes and revealed differentially expressed, highly altered lncRNAs in LUSC and LUAD. LncRNAs that act as oncogenes and lncRNA-regulating transcription factors provide novel targets for anti-lung cancer therapeutics.
We report on a 12-year-old Brazilian boy with the p.Pro49Arg mutation in PPP1CB, a novel gene associated with RASopathies. This is the fifth individual described, and the fourth presenting the same variant, suggesting a mutational hotspot. Phenotypically, he also showed the same hair pattern-sparse, thin, and with slow growing-, similar to the typical ectodermal finding observed in Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair. Additionally, he presented craniosynostosis, a rare clinical finding in RASopathies. This report gives further support that this novel RASopathy-PPP1CB-related Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair-shares great similarity to Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair, and expands the phenotypic spectrum by adding the cranial vault abnormality.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Current guidelines recommend that testing for Y chromosome material should be performed only in patients with Turner syndrome harboring a marker chromosome and exhibiting virilization in order to detect individuals who are at high risk of gonadoblastoma. However, cryptic Y chromosome material is suggested to be a risk factor for gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Here, we aimed to estimate the frequency of cryptic Y chromosome material in patients with Turner syndrome and determine whether Y chromosome material increased the risk for development of gonadoblastoma. A total of 124 patients who were diagnosed with Turner syndrome by conventional cytogenetic techniques underwent additional molecular analysis to detect cryptic Y chromosome material. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome harboring Y chromosome cell lines had their ovaries removed prophylactically. Finally, we assessed the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Molecular analysis demonstrated that 10 patients had Y chromosome material among 118 patients without overt Y chromosome (8.5%). Six patients with overt Y chromosome and four patients with cryptic Y chromosome material underwent oophorectomy. Histopathological analysis revealed that the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in the total group was 2.4%, and gonadoblastoma occurred in one of six patients with an overt Y chromosome (16.7%) and 2 of 10 patients with cryptic Y chromosome material (20.0%). The risk of developing gonadoblastoma in patients with cryptic Y chromosome material was similar to that in patients with overt Y chromosome. Therefore, molecular screening for Y chromosome material should be recommended for all patients with Turner syndrome to detect individuals at a high risk of gonadoblastoma and to facilitate proper management of the disease.
in English, FrenchLe syndrome de Marfan est une maladie systémique du tissu conjonctif qui se transmet de façon autosomale dominante. Elle est due à une mutation du gène codant pour la fibrilline-1, une glycoprotéine, constituant principal des microfibrilles de la matrice extra-cellullaire. La maladie touche principalement le squelette, les yeux et le système cardiovasculaire. Son expression phénotypique est variable avec des formes néonatales sévères, un tableau classique chez l’enfant ou le jeune adulte ou des lésions isolées d’un seul organe. Chez l’enfant, le phénotype évolue avec l’âge. Ainsi, le syndrome de Marfan peut n’être reconnu que tardivement, par exemple à l’occasion de manifestations de ses complications cardiovasculaires. Le cas d’un adolescent et de sa jeune sœur que nous rapportons ici illustre la variabilité phénotypique au sein d’une même famille, l’évolution des manifestations cliniques et la difficulté diagnostique chez l’enfant.The Marfan syndrome is a systemic connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. A mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene, a glycoprotein which is the main constituent of the extracellular matrix, is the cause of the disease. The cardinal features involve the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems. The expression of the Marfan syndrome varies from the severe neonatal presentation to the classical manifestations of the child and young adult, but also comprises isolated features. In children, phenotypical manifestations are age dependent. For these reasons, the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome might be lately revealed by its cardiovascular complications. We report the case of 2 siblings: it illustrates the phenotypic variability that might be observed in a same family, the phenotype evolution with age and the diagnosis challenge in childhood.
Regular low-impact physical activity is generally allowed in patients with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. However, being above average in height encourages young adults with this syndrome to engage in high-intensity contact sports, which unfortunately increases the risk for aortic aneurysm and rupture, the leading cause of death in Marfan syndrome. In this study, we investigated the effects of voluntary (cage-wheel) or forced (treadmill) aerobic exercise at different intensities on aortic function and structure in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. Four-week-old Marfan and wild-type mice were subjected to voluntary and forced exercise regimens or sedentary lifestyle for 5 mo. Thoracic aortic tissue was isolated and subjected to structural and functional studies. Our data showed that exercise improved aortic wall structure and function in Marfan mice and that the beneficial effect was biphasic, with an optimum at low intensity exercise (55-65% V̇o2max) and tapering off at a higher intensity of exercise (85% V̇o2max). The mechanism underlying the reduced elastin fragmentation in Marfan mice involved reduction of the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 within the aortic wall. These findings present the first evidence of potential beneficial effects of mild exercise on the structural integrity of the aortic wall in Marfan syndrome associated aneurysm. Our finding that moderate, but not strenuous, exercise protects aortic structure and function in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome could have important implications for the medical care of young Marfan patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study provides conclusive scientific evidence that daily exercise can improve aortic health in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome associated aortic aneurysm, and it establishes the threshold for the exercise intensity beyond which exercise may not be as protective. These findings establish a platform for a new focus on promoting regular exercise in Marfan patients at an optimum intensity and create a paradigm shift in clinical care of Marfan patients suffering from aortic aneurysm complications.
Lung carcinoma is the most common cause of malignant death worldwide. CD8 T cells, as critical elements in antitumor immunity, could function as good prognostic indicators in various kinds of cancers such as renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, but its prognostic role in lung adenocarcinoma is still unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the prognostic role of CD8 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.Paired tumor and adjacent noncancerous tissues were obtained from 102 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and CD8 expression of these samples was examined by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the relationships between the expression of CD8 and pathological grade, TNM stage, clinical stage, as well as overall survival (OS).Expression of CD8 was significantly increased in lung adenocarcinoma compared with that in adjacent lung adenocarcinoma (P < .001). CD8 expression was negatively correlated with pathological grade (r = -0.216, P = .022) and N stage (r = -0.372, P < .001), while no statistical correlation with T stage, or clinical stage. Importantly, OS was numerically increased in patients with high expression of CD8 than the group of intermediate and low CD8 expression (P = .12). Furthermore, CD8 could significantly increase OS (P = .043, HR: .713, 95%CI: .515-.989) by univariate Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis.Our data indicated that expression of CD8, as a protective factor, is correlated with the outcome of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, CD8 might be a novel prognostic biological marker for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a connective tissue defect. A nine-year-old girl was referred to our pediatric endocrinology clinic for tall stature. Physical examination revealed a lens dislocation with strabismus, high palate, positive wrist and thumb signs, joint hypermobility, and pes planus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed dilatation of the aortic root. She was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome based on the revised Ghent diagnostic criteria. Molecular investigation identified a heterozygous c.2810G >A variation in the FBN1 gene in the patient, but not in her parents. To our knowledge, this sequence variant has been reported as a polymorphism (rs113602180), but it is the first report identifying it as the genetic cause of Marfan syndrome. We hypothesize that this de novo novel missense FBN1 mutation disrupts fibrillin-1 function and is probably involved in the development of Marfan syndrome in this patient.
Turner syndrome is associated with increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, especially those of the thyroid gland. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity among pediatric patients with Turner syndrome. The study was retrospective and included 41 girls with Turner syndrome aged 6-18 years. Free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies, and karyotype were investigated. The correlation between karyotype and incidence of thyroid autoimmunity was also examined. Eleven patients (26.8%) were positive for TPO-Ab and/or TG-Ab. Three girls from that subgroup were euthyroid, 5 had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 3 were diagnosed with overt hypothyroidism. Out of these 11 patients affected by thyroid autoimmunity, 6 girls had mosaic karyotype with X-isochromosome (n = 4) or with deletions (n = 2), and 5 had the 45,X karyotype. The study findings confirmed a high incidence of thyroid autoimmunity in girls with Turner syndrome, but we failed to observe an association between the incidence of thyroid autoimmunity and karyotype. We conclude that it is important to monitor thyroid function in patients with Turner syndrome because they are prone to develop hypothyroidism.
Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic genetic condition affecting connective tissue. It carries a reduced life expectancy, largely dependent on cardiovascular complications. More common cardiac manifestations such as aortic dissection and aortic valve incompetence have been widely documented in the literature. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), however, has remained poorly documented. This article aims at exploring the existing literature on the pathophysiology and diagnosis of MVP in patients with Marfan syndrome, defining its current management and outlining the future developments surrounding it.
BACKGROUND: This study was to investigate the differential mitochondrial protein expressions in human lung adenocarcinoma and provide preliminary data for further exploration of the carcinogenic mechanism.METHODS: Total proteins of A549 and 16HBE mitochondria were extracted through 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The differential mitochondria proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and were further confirmed by Western blot, immunoelectron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in A549 cells as well as lung adenocarcinoma tissues.RESULTS: A total of 41 differentially expressed protein spots were found in A549 mitochondria. Of them, 15 proteins were highly expressed and 26 proteins were lowly expressed in the mitochondria of A549 (by more than 1.5 times). Among the 15 more highly expressed proteins, AAA-TOB3 (by more than 3 times) was highly expressed in the mitochondria of A549 compared with the 16HBE, by LC-MS/MS identification. High electron density and clear circular colloidal gold-marked AAA-TOB3 particles were observed in the A549 cells via immunoelectron microscopy. Besides, AAA-TOB3 was confirmed to be elevated in lung adenocarcinoma by Western blot and IHC. Moreover, increased AAA-TOB3 correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of lung adenocarcinoma (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: AAA-TOB3 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma, and the up-regulation of AAA-TOB3 correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of lung adenocarcinoma, which suggested that it could serve as a potential molecular marker for lung adenocarcinoma.
Turner syndrome (TS) is one of the most common sexual chromosome abnormalities and is clearly associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, particularly thyroid disease and coeliac disease (CD). Single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses have been shown to provide correlative evidence that specific genes are associated with autoimmune disease. Our aim was to study the functional polymorphic variants of PTPN22 and ZFAT in relation to thyroid disease and those of MYO9B in relation to CD. A cross-sectional comparative analysis was performed on Mexican mestizo patients with TS and age-matched healthy females. Our data showed that PTPN22 C1858T (considered a risk variant) is not associated with TS (X2  = 3.50, p = .61, and OR = 0.33 [95% CI = 0.10-1.10]). Also, ZFAT was not associated with TS (X2  = 1.2, p = .28, and OR = 1.22 [95% CI = 0.84-1.79]). However, for the first time, rs2305767 MYO9B was revealed to have a strong association with TS (X2  = 58.6, p = .0001, and OR = 10.44 [95% C = 5.51-19.80]), supporting a high level of predisposition to CD among TS patients. This report addresses additional data regarding the polymorphic variants associated with autoimmune disease, one of the most common complications in TS.
Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic condition occurring in females resulting from the loss of part or all of one of the X chromosomes. The two hallmark features of Turner syndrome include short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. In addition, Turner syndrome can involve multiple healthcare issues including cardiac and renal anomalies, autoimmune disorders, hearing loss, ophthalmologic issues, bone anomalies, dermatologic issues and psychosocial and educational concerns. The presenting signs of Turner syndrome can vary markedly, leading to delayed or even missed diagnosis. Early identification of TS allows for appropriate screening and surveillance evaluations and more timely treatment intervention. This article will provide an overview of the healthcare issues common to patients with TS, treatments available and the screening and surveillance testing that is recommended.
Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also called Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome that confers an elevated risk of early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) and increased lifetime risk for other cancers of the endometrium, stomach, small intestine, hepatobiliary system, kidney, ureter, and ovary. Lynch syndrome accounts for up to 3% of all CRC, making it the most common hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome. Germline mutations in methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) genes give rise to microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumor DNA. Lynch syndrome is most frequently caused by pathogrenic variants in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Germline mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 account for approximately 90% of detected mutations in families with Lynch syndrome. Pathogenic vatiants in MSH6 have been reported in approximately 7-10% of families with Lynch syndrome. Pathogenic variants in PMS2 account for fewer than 5% of mutations in families with Lynch syndrome. This unit presents a comprehensive molecular genetic testing strategy for Lynch syndrome including MSI analysis, next generation sequencing (NGS)-based targeted sequence analysis, PCR-based Sanger sequencing and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH).© 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
BACKGROUND: Colorectal carcinomas with high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) account for 15% of all colorectal cancers, including 12% of sporadic cases and 3% of cancers associated with Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, HNPCC). Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome, caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2.METHODS: Published articles from peer-reviewed journals were obtained from PubMed, Google Scholar and Clinicaltrials.gov . Based on the recent research data, we provide an update on the MSI testing, along with the evolving role of MSI in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of colorectal cancers.RESULTS: Studies have led to significant advances in the molecular pathogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of MSI-H colorectal cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that colorectal cancers with MSI-H show different outcome and treatment response from those with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. Therefore, MSI testing is essential not only in the genetic context, but it may also have important prognostic and predictive value of response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Many experts and professional authorities have recommended a universal MSI testing in all individuals newly diagnosed with colorectal cancers.
BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disease, presenting with dysfunction of connective tissues leading to lesions in the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle system. Within these symptoms, the most typical is weakness of the connective tissue in the aorta, manifesting as aortic dilatation (aneurysm). This could, in turn, become annuloaortic ectasia, or life-threatening dissection. As a result, life-saving and preventative cardiac surgical interventions are frequent among Marfan syndrome patients. Aortic aneurysm could turn into annuloaortic ectasia or life-threatening dissection, thus life-saving and preventive cardiac surgical interventions are frequent among patients with Marfan syndrome. We hypothesized that patients with Marfan syndrome have different level of anxiety, depression and satisfaction with life compared to that of the non-clinical patient population.METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome were divided into 3 groups: those scheduled for prophylactic surgery, those needing acute surgery, and those without need for surgery (n = 9, 19, 17, respectively). To examine the psychological features of the patients, Spielberger's anxiety (STAI) test, Beck's Depression questionnaire (BDI), the Berne Questionnaire of Subjective Well-being, and the Satisfaction with Life scale were applied.RESULTS: A significant difference was found in trait anxiety between healthy individuals and patients with Marfan syndrome after acute life-saving surgery (p < 0.01). The mean score of Marfan syndrome patients was 48.56 (standard deviation (SD): 5.8) as compared to the STAI population mean score of 43.72 (SD: 8.53). No difference was found between groups on the BDI (p > 0.1). Finally, a significant, medium size effect was found between patient groups on the Joy in Living scale (F (2.39) = 3.51, p = 0.040, η2 = 0.15).CONCLUSIONS: Involving psychiatric and mental-health care, in addition to existing surgical treatment interventions, is essential for more successful recovery of patients with Marfan syndrome.
Dysregulation of SLC34A2 (NaPi2b) in tumors has attracted wide attention, but its expression and function in non-small cell lung cancer remains unclear. By examining its expression in lung adenocarcinoma and correlation to patient outcome, we aimed to explore its prognostic and therapeutic values in this deadly disease. Overall, 175 cases of lung adenocarcinoma sample were included in this study. Histological subtyping of them was diagnosed according to standards of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society in 2011. Protein expression of SLC34A2 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase in these samples was determined by immunohistochemistry. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were examined using amplification refractory mutation system. Statistical analysis was performed using software of Pearson's correlation coefficient. High expression of SLC34A2 was identified in about 2/3 patients and correlated with significantly better patient's overall survival. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were detected in about 53% of patients with no statistically significant difference to patient's overall survival. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement was found in 8 out of 175 patients, harboring this abnormality leads to shorter overall survival. No correlation has been found between SLC34A2 expression and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma. High expression of SLC34A2 is present in about 3/4 lung adenocarcinoma samples and predicts better outcome. Since it is a membrane protein, antibody-based drugs targeting this marker might bring new resolution to this deadly disease.
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between predominant subtype, classification, and prognosis in Chinese stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) International Multidisciplinary Lung Adenocarcinoma Classification.METHODS: Between 2000 and 2010, 110 patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma underwent surgery at Xuanwu Hospital. Two pathologists independently reclassified all resected specimens according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis.RESULTS: There were no cases of adenocarcinoma in situ, and three cases of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. There were 107 cases of invasive adenocarcinoma: 12 lepidic, 32 acinar, 30 papillary, 18 micropapillary, and 15 solid predominant subtypes. Patients with micropapillary and solid predominant tumors had significantly poorer disease-free survival compared to those with other subtypes of predominant tumors (P = 0.021). Multivariate analysis revealed that the new classification (P = 0.003) and T stage (P = 0.034) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival, respectively.CONCLUSION: The predominant subtype in the primary tumor was associated with prognosis in resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma.© 2017 The Authors.

Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that can affect many organ systems. Affected patients present with orthopaedic manifestations of the syndrome during all phases of life. Pain caused by musculoskeletal abnormalities often requires definitive orthopaedic treatment. Orthopaedic surgeons must understand the phenotypes of Marfan syndrome so they can recognize when screening is warranted and can appropriately address the skeletal manifestations. Through medical advancements, patients with Marfan syndrome are living longer and more active lives. Knowledge of the latest diagnostic criteria for the disorder, as well as of advances in understanding the skeletal phenotype, clinical trials of medication therapy, and lifestyle considerations is important for orthopaedic surgeons who treat these patients because these clinicians often are the first to suspect Marfan syndrome and recommend screening.
The following is a case report of 6 patients with Noonan syndrome (NS) and/or a related RASsopathy that also have evidence of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC). Noonan syndrome,a type of RASopathy, is an autosomal dominant disorder that is typically associated with congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There have been minimal reports of Noonan syndrome or other RASopathy and the association of LVNC. This report promulgates 6 nonrelated cases of Noonan syndrome or unspecified RASopathy and LVNC.
Most of cancer-related deaths are due to lung cancer, and there is a need for reliable prognosis biomarkers to predict stages in lung adenocarcinoma cases. Recently, microRNAs are found to have potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer. As evidence suggests microRNA dysregulations are implicated in many cancer malignancies, it is important to consider the changes in miRNA-target associations among different lung cancer biological states. We proposed a novel clustering strategy to identify groups of miRNAs with similar dysregulated targets. Then, we incorporated the learned clusters of miRNA as prior knowledge to a Sparse Group Lasso classifier to improve classification results, thereby leading to more relevant selection of microRNA biomarkers. We apply the method to the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma dataset. In cross-validation tests, the AUC rate for each stages is 1.0, 0.71, 0.68, 0.64, and 0.90 for normal, Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV, respectively. Among the candidate miRNAs selected in the model, 87% are reported to be related to Lung Adenocarcinoma. Further result demonstrates that clustering miRNAs by considering the dysregulation between miRNAs and mRNA targets leads to biomarkers with higher precision and recall rate to known lung adenocarcinoma miRNAs.
Cohesin is crucial for genome stability, cell division, transcription and chromatin organization. Its functions critically depend on NIPBL, the cohesin-loader protein that is found to be mutated in >60% of the cases of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). Other mutations are described in the cohesin subunits SMC1A, RAD21, SMC3 and the HDAC8 protein. In 25-30% of CdLS cases no mutation in the known CdLS genes is detected. Until now, functional elements in the noncoding genome were not characterized in the molecular etiology of CdLS and therefore are excluded from mutation screening, although the impact of such mutations has now been recognized for a wide range of diseases. We have identified different elements of the noncoding genome involved in regulation of the NIPBL gene. NIPBL-AS1 is a long non-coding RNA transcribed upstream and antisense to NIPBL. By knockdown and transcription blocking experiments, we could show that not the NIPBL-AS1 gene product, but its actual transcription is important to regulate NIPBL expression levels. This reveals a possibility to boost the transcriptional activity of the NIPBL gene by interfering with the NIPBL-AS1 lncRNA. Further, we have identified a novel distal enhancer regulating both NIPBL and NIPBL-AS1. Deletion of the enhancer using CRISPR genome editing in HEK293T cells reduces expression of NIPBL, NIPBL-AS1 as well as genes found to be dysregulated in CdLS.
Noonan syndrome is characterized by typical craniofacial dysmorphism, postnatal growth retardation, congenital heart defect, and learning difficulties and belongs to the RASopathies, a group of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by germline mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Mutations in the RAF1 gene are associated with Noonan syndrome, with a high prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). RAF1 mutations cluster in exons encoding the conserved region 2 (CR2), the kinase activation segment of the CR3 domain, and the C-terminus. We present two boys with Noonan syndrome and the identical de novo RAF1 missense variant c.1082G>C/p.(Gly361Ala) affecting the CR3, but located outside the kinase activation segment. The p.(Gly361Ala) mutation has been identified as a RAF1 allele conferring resistance to RAF inhibitors. This amino acid change favors a RAF1 conformation that allows for enhanced RAF dimerization and increased intrinsic kinase activity. Both patients with Noonan syndrome showed typical craniofacial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, and short stature. One individual developed HCM and was diagnosed with a disseminated oligodendroglial-like leptomeningeal tumor (DOLT) of childhood at the age of 9 years. While there is a well-established association of NS with malignant tumors, especially childhood hemato-oncological diseases, brain tumors have rarely been reported in Noonan syndrome. Our data demonstrate that mutation scanning of the entire coding region of genes associated with Noonan syndrome is mandatory not to miss rare variants located outside the known mutational hotspots.
Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome for which mutations in five causative genes that encode (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21) or regulate (NIPBL, HDAC8) the cohesin complex, account for ~70% of cases. Herein we report on four female Subjects who were found to carry novel intragenic deletions in HDAC8. In one case, the deletion was found in mosaic state and it was determined to be present in ~38% of blood lymphocytes and in nearly all cells of a buccal sample. All deletions, for which parental blood samples were available, were shown to have arisen de novo. X-chromosome inactivation studies demonstrated marked skewing, suggesting strong selection against the mutated HDAC8 allele. Based on an investigation of the deletion breakpoints, we hypothesize that microhomology-mediated replicative mechanisms may be implicated in the formation of some of these rearrangements. This study broadens the mutational spectrum of HDAC8, provides the first description of a causative HDAC8 somatic mutation and increases the knowledge on possible mutational mechanisms underlying copy number variations in HDAC8. Moreover our findings highlight the clinical utility of considering copy number analysis in HDAC8 as well as the analysis on DNA from more than one tissue as an indispensable part of the routine molecular diagnosis of individuals with CdLS or CdLS-overlapping features.
Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a complex disorder with multiple structural and developmental defects caused by mutations in structural and regulatory proteins involved in the cohesin complex. NIPBL, a cohesin regulatory protein, has been identified as a critical protein responsible for the orchestration of transcriptomic regulatory networks necessary for embryonic development. Mutations in NIPBL are responsible for the majority of cases of CdLS. Through RNA-sequencing of human induced pluripotent stem cells and in vitro-derived cardiomyocytes, we identified hundreds of mRNAs, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs with altered expression in NIPBL+/- patient-derived cells. We demonstrate that NIPBL haploinsufficiency leads to upregulation of gene sets identified in functions related to nucleosome, chromatin assembly, RNA modification and downregulation of Wnt signaling, cholesterol biosynthesis and vesicular transport in iPSC and cardiomyocytes. Mutations in NIPBL result in the dysregulation of many genes responsible for normal heart development likely resulting in the variety of structural cardiac defects observed in the CdLS population.
We found that the clinical phenotype associated with BRD4 haploinsufficiency overlapped with that of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), which is most often caused by mutation of NIPBL. More typical CdLS was observed with a de novo BRD4 missense variant, which retained the ability to coimmunoprecipitate with NIPBL, but bound poorly to acetylated histones. BRD4 and NIPBL displayed correlated binding at super-enhancers and appeared to co-regulate developmental gene expression.
Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare disease characterized by cognitive impairment, multisystemic alterations and premature aging. Furthermore, CdLS cells display gene expression dysregulation and genomic instability. Here, we demonstrated that treatment with antioxidant drugs, such as ascorbic acid and riboceine, reduced the level of genomic instability and extended the in vitro lifespan of CdLS cell lines. We also found that antioxidant treatment partially rescued the phenotype of a zebrafish model of CdLS. Gene expression profiling showed that antioxidant drugs caused dysregulation of gene transcription; notably, a number of genes coding for the zinc finger (ZNF)-containing Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) protein domain (KRAB-ZNF) were found to be downregulated. Taken together, these data suggest that antioxidant drugs have the potential to ameliorate the developmental phenotype of CdLS.
AIM: To study the expression profile of NFIX, its prognostic value and the mechanism of its dysregulation in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Patients & materials: A retrospective study was performed by using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Human Protein Atlas.RESULTS: High NFIX RNA expression was an independent prognostic factor of favorable overall survival (HR: 0.687, 95% CI: 0.496-0.951; p = 0.024) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 0.700, 95% CI: 0.493-0.994, p = 0.046) in LUAD, but not in lung squamous cell carcinoma. NFIX DNA hypermethylation was associated with significantly decreased NFIX expression and shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival in LUAD.CONCLUSION:  NFIX downregulation might independently predict poor prognosis in LUAD. DNA hypermethylation might be an important cause of the downregulation.
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients. Biomarkers predicting survival of patients with lung cancer have a profound effect on patient prognosis and treatment. However, predictive biomarkers for survival and their relevance for lung cancer are not been well known yet. The objective of this study was to perform machine learning with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to find survival-specific gene mutations that could be used as survival-predicting biomarkers. To identify survival-specific mutations according to various clinical factors, four feature selection methods (information gain, chi-squared test, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and correlation) were used. Extracted survival-specific mutations of LUAD were applied individually or as a group for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Mutations in MMRN2 and GMPPA were significantly associated with patient mortality while those in ZNF560 and SETX were associated with patient survival. Mutations in DNAJC2 and MMRN2 showed significant negative association with overall survival while mutations in ZNF560 showed significant positive association with overall survival. Mutations in MMRN2 showed significant negative association with disease-free survival while mutations in DRD3 and ZNF560 showed positive associated with disease-free survival. Mutations in DRD3, SETX, and ZNF560 showed significant positive association with survival in patients with LUAD while the opposite was true for mutations in DNAJC2, GMPPA, and MMRN2. These gene mutations were also found in other cohorts of LUAD, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. In LUAD of Pan-Lung Cancer cohort, mutations in GMPPA, DNAJC2, and MMRN2 showed significant negative associations with survival of patients while mutations in DRD3 and SETX showed significant positive association with survival. In this study, machine learning was conducted to obtain information necessary to discover specific gene mutations associated with the survival of patients with LUAD. Mutations in the above six genes could predict survival rate and disease-free survival rate in patients with LUAD. Thus, they are important biomarker candidates for prognosis.
